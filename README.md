The main reason of creating this Flask-MVT pattern served problem with circular imports.
Besides, I am keen on coding on Flask because of his opportunities of customizing.
In Django you can meet a lot of troubles which are due with customizing of it, so I thought
that I had to find something better then Django and I met Flask.
I wanted to create system that can let me work with apps the same as in Django.
